    "\n",
    "> Most states in the USA provide services and support to individuals with developmental disabilities (e.g., intellectual disability, cerebral palsy, autism, etc.) and their families. The agency through which the State of California serves the developmentally-disabled population is the California Department of Developmental Services (DDS) ... One of the responsibilities of DDS is to allocate funds that support over 250,000 developmentally-disabled residents. A number of years ago, an allegation of discrimination was made and supported by a univariate analysis that examined average annual expenditures on consumers by ethnicity. The analysis revealed that the average annual expenditures on Hispanic consumers was approximately one-third of the average expenditures on White non-Hispanic consumers. This finding was the catalyst for further investigation; subsequently, state legislators and department managers sought consulting services from a statistician.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, you'll analyze the deidentified DDS data published with this article to answer the question: *is there evidence of ethnic or gender discrimination in allocation of DDS funds?* This will involve practicing the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "* exploratory data visualization\n",
    "* regression analysis\n",
    "* model visualization\n",
    "\n",
    "**Aside**: The JSE article focuses on what's known as [Simpson's paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simpson%27s_paradox), an arithmetic phenomenon in which aggregate trends across multiple groups show the *opposite* of within-group trends. We won't emphasize this topic, though the data does provide a nice illustration."

The observational units were the individuals who recieved funds from the California Department of Developmental Services. The population of interest is all individuals in California with a developmental disorder who recieves funds from this service (more than 250,000 'consumers'). The data documentation does not say specifically what type of sampling was done to get the data other than that it is a sample of the 250,000 data points they have. I think that inferences can be drawn about the population from the sample because it is large enough to understand or get a general grasp of the population as long as it is a random sample.\n"

    "> The 0-5 cohort (preschool age) has the fewest needs and requires the least amount of funding. For the 6-12 cohort (elementary school age) and 13-17 (high school age), a number of needed services are provided by schools. The 18-21 cohort is typically in a transition phase as the consumers begin moving out from their parents’ homes into community centers or living on their own. The majority of those in the 22-50 cohort no longer live with their parents but may still receive some support from their family. Those in the 51+ cohort have the most needs and require the most amount of funding because they are living on their own or in community centers and often have no living parents."

    "After visualizing all the data into simple graphs and looking at estimations on this topic, I can conclude that the data does not provide any evidence of ethnic or gender discrimination in the allocation of DDS funds. From figure 1, it appears as though the median allocation of funds is affected by the ethnicity of the individual but figures 2 and 4 work together to show that the reason for the differences is actually based on the age of the individual rather than ethnicity. Figure 4 shows a fairly even median of expenditures between ethnicities accounting for the age. As we see with figure 3, ethnicities such as White have a much higher ratio of older to younger individuals which will result in a higher median of expenditures. By using linear regression and estimation, I found that there is no evidence to support that expenditure is affected by ethnicity and Gender but only by Age. We can also see this in figure 5 where I make two plots of the mean estimated expenditure by ethnicity and age cohort the individual and separate the plots by gender. From this figure, we can see that the estimations between ethnicity and gender are extremely similar and the only visible differences is due to the Age."
